== Installation ==

1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance -> Themes and click the Add New button.
2. Click Upload and Choose File, then select the theme's .zip file. Click Install Now.
3. Click Activate to use your new theme right away.

== Content Options (requires Jetpack - jetpack.me) ==

Clge supports all Content Options, including the ability to display your choice of full post content or excerpts on the blog and archives.

== Custom Menus ==

Clge comes with a Custom Menu location, which sits below the header and can display multiple nested submenus. To add items to the menu:
1. Go to Customize > Menus.
2. If you haven't created a menu yet, create one and select the menu location "Header."

== Social Links Menu (requires Jetpack - jetpack.me)==

With Clge, you have the option to display links to your social media profiles in the header. To display them, set up a Social Links Menu.

Linking to any of the following sites will automatically display its icon in your menu:
* CodePen
* Digg
* Dribbble
* Dropbox
* Facebook
* Flickr
* GitHub
* Google+
* Instagram
* LinkedIn
* Email (mailto: links)
* Pinterest
* Pocket
* Polldaddy
* Reddit
* RSS Feed (urls with /feed/)
* StumbleUpon
* Tumblr
* Twitter
* Vimeo
* WordPress
* YouTube

== Widget Areas ==

Clge offers four widget areas:

* The optional Sidebar, which appears on the right in single posts and pages using the default template.
* Three optional Footer widget areas.

If there are no widgets in the Sidebar area, the theme automatically adjusts to a single column.

== Site Logo ==

Clge supports the Site Logo feature. To add your own image, go to Customize > Site Identity. The logo will appear in the header, above the site title.

== Custom Header ==

You can customize Clge's header by uploading your own Custom Header Image, which will appear behind the site title as a background image. Decorative images work best in this space.

== Page Templates ==

Clge comes with three custom page templates: a Full-Width template, a No-Sidebar template, and a Contributors template.

Both the Full-Width and No-Sidebar templates feature a single column of content. The Full-Width template's content area is quite wide, making it perfect for displaying larger media like videos, photos, and maps.

The No-Sidebar template displays a single column of content that is the same width as single posts and pages, and the column is centered.

The Contributors template displays your site's authors in a grid. Their names, Gravatars, and profile descriptions are included, as well as links to their own post archives and websites.

To change the Page Template of any new/published page, go to Pages and click the name of the page you want to edit. On the page editing screen, look for the Page Attributes module and choose the page template that you want from the Page Template drop-down menu.

== Post Formats ==

Clge supports all Post Formats, and includes unique styles to help different kinds of content stand out.

== Quick Specs (all measurements in pixels) ==
* The main column width on posts and pages is 756, and 1120 for the Full-Width template
* Custom Header dimensions are fluid, displayed at varying widths and heights, depending on the screen size.
* Featured Images are 945 wide; 1400 wide when using the Full-Width template. There is no height limit.
* The Site Logo appears at a maximum width of 300 and height of 160.
